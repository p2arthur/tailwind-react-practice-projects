This app is a practicing project to implement a tailwind responsive css layout into a basic subscription form with basic authentication. So far it was a challenge to implement a basic form validation but I gave the best of the knowledge I have today so that's it. I might practice it more in the near future.

Enter your email, if its valid and it's not already registered, the data will be sent to a local database and get stored there.

I need to learn more about how to document my code. But this is just the beginning so I will get better with time.

Thank you so much if you're reading this! :) <3
